# Ultra Quick Documentation Fix

## Issue Title: Add version number to system status

## Description:
The system status should show the current version number for better tracking.

## Current Behavior:
System status shows various metrics but no version information

## Expected Behavior:
System status should display the version number at the top

## Quick Fix:
Add version constant and display it in show_system_status() method

## Solution:
```python
# At the top of main.py, add:
VERSION = "1.0.0"

# In show_system_status() method, add after the header:
print(f"ðŸ”¢ Version: {VERSION}")
```
